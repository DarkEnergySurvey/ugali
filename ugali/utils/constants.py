# Determination of magnitude limits is rather complicated.
# The technique applied here is to derive the magnitude at
# which the 10sigma signal-to-noise threshold is reached.
# For SDSS, these values are (Table 21):
# u=22.12,g=22.60,r=22.29,i=21.85,z=20.35 
# However, the quoted 95% completeness limits are (Table 2):
# u=22.0,g=22.2,r=22.2,i=21.3,z=20.5
# What is responsible for this disconnect? Well, I think 
# the completeness was estimated by comparing with COSMOS
# on nights that weren't all that good seeing.
# The second set of numbers agree with those listed here:
# http://www.sdss3.org/dr10/scope.php

# http://des-docdb.fnal.gov:8080/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=20
# DES simple magnitude limits come from the science 
# requirements document. These are 'requirements'
# are somewhat pessimistic and the document also
# conatains 'goals' for the magnitude limit:
# g=25.4, r=24.9, i=24.6, z=23.8, y=21.7
# Of course all of this is yet to be verified with
# data...
